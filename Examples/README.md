### Purpose

The `examples/` folder contains mock data files that the Python module can intake and export. These files serve several important purposes:

- **Testing**: They provide test data for unit tests and integration tests, ensuring that the module can handle real-world scenarios and edge cases.
- **Demonstration**: They illustrate how data should be structured and formatted when using the module, providing a reference for developers and users.
- **Development**: They assist in the development process by offering consistent and repeatable datasets for debugging and feature implementation.

### Structure

The `examples/` folder contains JSON files with mock data representing various entities and scenarios. Here is an example of the structure:

```plaintext
ðŸ“‚examples
 â”£ ðŸ“œexample1.json
 â”£ ðŸ“œexample2.json
 â”£ ðŸ“œexample3.json
 â”— ðŸ“œ...
```

### Using the Example Files

- **Loading Data**: The module can load these example files to test its data intake functionality. This ensures that the module correctly processes and understands the data format.
- **Exporting Data**: The module can also export data into a format similar to these examples, allowing you to verify that the output matches the expected structure.
- **Modifying Examples**: If you need to test specific scenarios or edge cases, you can modify these example files or create new ones with the desired data.

### **Validation**:

- Use the python bundle import method as validation to ensure that any new or modified example files are correctly formatted and valid.
